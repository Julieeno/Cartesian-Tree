# Cartesian-Tree
Among the overview of data structure to manage and organise information, there is a particular model, based on the properties of an ordered 

**heap** and in the meantime in a symmetric (in-order) traversal of the tree, that returns the original sequence. This is the **Cartesian tree**, a 

binary tree derived from a sequence of numbers. 

This data structure could have several applications,in fact it could be used:

-in the definition of the treap,

-in the definition of the randomized binary search tree data structures for binary
search problems,

-in the solving for sorting problems.
